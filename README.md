# My First Physics Engine (Lecture)
Source code made of several steps for a basic physics engine implementation using vanilla JS, used as a lecture tool for beginners.

The steps are:
1. Create a basic page with canvas and draw a ball.
2. Add buttons to add/delete new balls.
3. Add input to determine the initial velocity of the balls.
4. Make the balls bounce when reaching a wall.
5. Add gravity control input, and an air-friction to make the ball's y speed shrink over time.
6. Ensure the balls cannot fall of the ground, and add ground friction (x axis).
